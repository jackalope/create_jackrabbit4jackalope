<h1>A patched Jackrabbit for Jackalope</h1>
<p>The stock Jackrabbit (as of the 2.2.x series) doesn't provide some patches we need to have for <a href="http://jackalope.github.com/">Jackalope</a> or we'd like to have.</p>
<p>Therefore we maintain a patched version of Jackrabbit on <a href="https://github.com/jackalope/jackrabbit">https://github.com/jackalope/jackrabbit</a>, the applied patches are described here: 
<a href="https://github.com/jackalope/jackrabbit/blob/2.2-jackalope/README.jackalope.patches.md">https://github.com/jackalope/jackrabbit/blob/2.2-jackalope/README.jackalope.patches.md</a>
</p>
<p>The scripts for generating this site and the jar can be found here <a href="https://github.com/jackalope/create_jackrabbit4jackalope">https://github.com/jackalope/create_jackrabbit4jackalope</a></p>

<p>Here on this site we just want to provde a compiled binary of jackrabbit-standalone-2.2.x-jackalope-SNAPSHOT.jar for convenience and an easy start.
See the link below for the actual link
